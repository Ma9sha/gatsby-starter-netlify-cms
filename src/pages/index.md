  Thomas John Barnardo was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1845. As a young man he
  moved to London to train as a doctor. When he arrived, he was shocked to find
  children living in terrible conditions, with no access to education. Poverty
  and disease were so widespread that one in five children died before their
  fifth birthday. When a cholera epidemic swept through the East End, leaving
  3000 people dead and many orphaned children, the young Barnardo felt an urgent
  need to help.

        In 1873 Barnardo married Syrie Louise Elmslie, who was to play an important role in the development of the charity. As a wedding present, they were given a lease on a 60-acre site in Barkingside,east London, where the couple opened a home for girls.
